# Welcome to the source code for my personal website.

## Note:

- I am using a _very_ basic Jekyll theme named "no-style-please", originally done by Riccardo Graziosi, and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). I am in no way trying to take credit away from them, and will attach their README as well to this repository for anyone else curious to do something similar.

## Features

- Fast (**1kb of CSS!**)![](logo.png)
- Responsive
- Content first (typography optimized for maximum readability)
- SEO optimized (uses [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag))
- RSS feed (uses [Jekyll Feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed))
- Fully compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (see [GitHub Pages installation](#github-pages-installation))
