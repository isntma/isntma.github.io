# Welcome to the source code for my personal website.

## Note:

- I am using a _very_ basic Jekyll theme named "no-style-please", and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). I am in no way trying to take credit away from them (this is a studies project but its become my own personal website).

- Responsive
- Content first (typography optimized for maximum readability)
