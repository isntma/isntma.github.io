#### challenge

This is the script that violates the web

```
<!-- Challenge -->
<h2 id="maname"></h2>
<script>
    let jeff = (new URL(location).searchParams.get('jeff') || "JEFFF")
    let ma = ""
    eval(`ma = "Ma name ${jeff}"`)
    setTimeout(_ => {
        maname.innerText = ma    }, 1000)
</script>
```

#### my solution

For this challenge we see that the code has an eval, this is a function that what it does is evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string. So we have to escape that function somehow, I've escaped it using "-example-"

[Ma name JEFFF](https://sandbox.pwnfunction.com/warmups/jefff.html?jeff=%3Cscript%3E%22-alert(%27win%27)-%22%3C/script%3E)

#### creator solution

The solution given by the creator of the game is as follows

`"-alert(1337)-"`
