## ASCII

This is the string to decrypt, we see a bunch of alphanumerics characters...

```
4C6520666C6167206465206365206368616C6C656E6765206573743A203261633337363438316165353436636436383964356239313237356433323465
```

When I saw it I knew it was hex. then If we go to [Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/) and decode `From Hex` we get this:

`Le flag de ce challenge est: 2ac376481ae546cd...`

## UU

For this challenge this is the string to decode:

```
_=_ 
_=_ Part 001 of 001 of file root-me_challenge_uudeview
_=_ 

begin 644 root-me_challenge_uudeview
B5F5R>2!S:6UP;&4@.RD*4$%34R`](%5,5%)!4TE-4$Q%"@``
`
end
```

I don't even know what encoding are this, but with one search I find out. The site for decode this is [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/uu-encoding). and... here is the flag:

`PASS = ULT...`
